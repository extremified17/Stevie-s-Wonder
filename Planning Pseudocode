# Stevie-s-Wonder
# Waterfall-esque board code for the Arduino #

1) Declare Inputs and Variables
- variable active to label all scenarios in common system
- variables start and end for scenarios with 2 buttons in conjunction
- variables n1-3 for scenarios with 3 buttons in conjunction

- make digital pins 1-6 inputs to take note if there's energy coming
- make digital pins 7-13 outputs to manipulate where energy goes/which light it goes to

2) Classifying Scenarios
- Read input pins to see which pins electricity is allowed/made to flow through (by pushing a button/switch)

   1 Button Scenarios:
   - use 'active' variable in a one digit number to label these
   
   2 Button Scenarios:
   - use 'active' variable in a two digit number to label these, and label the start and finish of the pattern
   
   3 Button Scenarios:
   - use 'active' variable in a three digit number to label these
   - label each input on in ascending order with the n1 to n3 variables
   
   4 Button Scenarios:
